# UnityGame-PrinceOfVengeance
This is a game I made in 2017 as part of my final project for the degree of 'Técnico En Diseño y Programación de Videojuegos' (equivalent to: Associate degree in Videogame Programming and Design).
## Description
This is a top-down medieval-style 2D RPG game aimed for Android devices. </br>
You control a hero that has to open his path through a castle while fighting enemies. The enemies that you kill gives you experience that will help you to level up.</br>
After achieving certain levels you can get new skills. </br>
Some enemies can drop combat gear that you can equip. </br>
As you progress in the game you will be fighting bosses with special skills.
